### tools which are used for API Testing :
Postman, Katalon Studio, Soap UI, Parasoft, REST assured, Tricentis Tosca, Ping API, Assertible

### What exactly we check during API testing :
Data accuracy.
Response time.
Duplicate or missing functionality.
Authorization checks.
Multithreaded issues.
Security and performance issues.
Error codes if API returns.
Reliability issues.

### HTTP response status codes
Informational responses (100 – 199)
Successful responses (200 – 299)
Redirection messages (300 – 399)
Client error responses (400 – 499)
Server error responses (500 – 599)

## POSTMAN introduction
### Postman Client
HTTP Client is a Program that uses HTTP to sent request to and receive responce from web server.

### SOAP vs REST vs GraphQL
SOAP, REST, and GraphQL are all web service APIs that have different strengths and weaknesses. The best choice depends on the requirements of the application. 

#### SOAP
Use: SOAP is well-suited for large, distributed environments like financial services, e-commerce, and telecommunications. 
Features: SOAP uses XML to exchange information, and provides built-in error handling. 

#### REST
Use: REST is a popular choice for public APIs, like e-commerce sites. 
Features: REST is simple and intuitive, and follows HTTP standards. XML and JSON

#### GraphQL
Use: GraphQL is a good choice for modern applications that require flexible data queries and reduced data transfer. 
Features: GraphQL is a query language that allows you to specify exactly what data you need. 

## HTTP Methods
### GET
